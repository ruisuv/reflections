When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are collaboriting with another person and share the progress for everyone.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Since this way I can have control for when I want to get the changes that other people have send to remote
