How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because you can view the changes that were made from version to another it is easier to get the exact which line was modified and caused the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    If you manually indicates that the changes you have made would be saved that is a different, significant version and not only a correction. Also you could restore the file from a specific point. However, when you are using automatic saves you do not need to worry if you loss your because your work was saved instantly

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is for whole projects and generally you do not change only a file but is "cascade modification".
